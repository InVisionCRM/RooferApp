# ✅ Database Setup Complete!

## What Was Done

### 1. Fixed Environment File
- Created clean `.env` file with only essential variables
- Fixed syntax error that was preventing Prisma from reading the file

### 2. Synced with Existing Database
- Pulled existing schema from your Neon PostgreSQL database
- Preserved all 22 existing models and data
- Added camera app specific tables

### 3. Added Camera App Tables

**New Tables Created:**
- ✅ `PhotoAssignment` - Assigns photo jobs to contractors
- ✅ `PhotoUploadLog` - Audit trail for photo uploads
- ✅ Added `CONTRACTOR` to `UserRole` enum

**Existing Tables (Preserved):**
- ✅ 89 Leads
- ✅ 34 LeadPhotos
- ✅ 13 Users
- ✅ All other CRM data intact

## 🎯 Database Status

```
✅ Schema synced

## 🔍 Verify Your Database

**Prisma Studio is running at:** http://localhost:5555

You can:
1. Browse all tables
2. View existing leads and photos
3. Create test PhotoAssignments
4. Verify the new tables exist

## 🧪 Next Steps - Testing

### 1. Create a Test Photo Assignment

In Prisma Studio:
1. Go to `PhotoAssignment` model
2. Click "Add record"
3. Fill in:
   - `leadId`: Choose an existing lead ID
   - `contractorPhone`: `5551234567` (or any number)
   - `assignedBy`: `admin`
   - `notes`: "Test assignment"
4. Save

### 2. Test Login

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. The camera app should be ready to use!
