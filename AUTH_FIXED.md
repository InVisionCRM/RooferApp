# ✅ Authentication Fixed!

## 🔧 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: PrismaAdapter Incompatibility
**Problem:** Using PrismaAdapter with CredentialsProvider
**Solution:** Removed PrismaAdapter, using JWT-only sessions

### Issue #2: Missing Email Field
**Problem:** User model requires email (non-nullable)
**Solution:** Auto-generate email: `{phone}@contractor.local`

### Issue #3: Database Connection Pooler
**Problem:** "User was denied access on the database"
- Neon's connection pooler (pgbouncer) blocks some Prisma operations
- Pooled URL: `ep-winter-frost-a5yzczxj-pooler` ❌
**Solution:** Use direct unpooled connection
- Unpooled URL: `ep-winter-frost-a5yzczxj` ✅
