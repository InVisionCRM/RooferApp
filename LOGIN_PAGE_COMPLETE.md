## 🎯 How to Test

### 1. Create a Test Assignment

**In Prisma Studio** (http://localhost:5555):
1. Go to `Lead` table → Pick any lead and copy its `id`
2. Go to `PhotoAssignment` table → Click "Add record"
3. Fill in:
   ```
   leadId: <paste-lead-id>
   contractorPhone: 5551234567
   assignedBy: admin
   notes: Test - take before photos
   ```
4. Save

### 2. Test the Login Flow

**Visit:** http://localhost:3000

1. Should redirect to `/login` (not authenticated)
2. Enter phone: `5551234567` (or `(555) 123-4567` - auto-formats)
3. Click "Sign In"
4. Should authenticate and redirect to `/` (job list)
5. Should see your test assignment in the job list!

### 3. Test Authentication

- Try accessing http://localhost:3000 directly → redirects to login
- Login with valid phone → shows jobs
- Click "Sign Out" → back to login
- Try invalid phone → shows error message
